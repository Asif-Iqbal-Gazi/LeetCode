# 🧮 LeetCode Solutions (C, C++, Python, Rust)

Welcome to my repository of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) solutions implemented in **C**, **C++**, **Python**, and **Rust**.  
This is a personal challenge to revisit problems in multiple languages, exploring algorithmic thinking and language-specific strengths.

Each folder:
- Represents one LeetCode problem.
- Contains implementations in multiple languages.
- Includes a problem-specific `README.md` with explanation and complexity analysis.

## 🎯 Goals

- Re-implement previously solved problems across multiple languages.
- Strengthen foundational problem-solving skills.
- Improve fluency in system-level (C, Rust) and high-level (Python, C++) languages.

## ⚙️ How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asif-Iqbal-Gazi/LeetCode.git
cd LeetCode
```

Navigate into any problem directory and run/compile in your language of choice.

🛠️ In Progress

-  [x] Add base structure
-  [x] Problem-specific README files
-  [ ] Convert previous folder structure to conform to this format
-  [ ] Add Contest structure
-  [ ] Add a guide to have driver code so that these can be ran/compiled locally.
