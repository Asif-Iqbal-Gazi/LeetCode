## 🧠 Problem

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return *the **number of indices** where* `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

### ✳️ Examples

**Example 1:**

    **Input:** heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:**
    heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
    expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
    Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

**Example 2:**

    **Input:** heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
    **Output:** 5
    **Explanation:**
    heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
    expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
    All indices do not match.

**Example 3:**

    **Input:** heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:**
    heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
    expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
    All indices match.

## 📌 Constraints

- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`

---

## 🚀 Approach

Use **Counting Sort** (heights[i] <= 100, small constant memory) to simulate the sorted order without actually sorting, then count mismatches with the original array.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
